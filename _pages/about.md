## 🔬 Research Topics
 I am specializing in the following research areas:

 **Topic 2: Pysicis-informed (PI) AI for Traffic/Congestion Prediction**
 Traditional AI models for traffic prediction rely on purely data-driven approaches, which often struggle with generalization, especially in unseen traffic conditions. Incorporating physics-informed AI (PI-AI) integrates fundamental traffic flow theories into machine learning models. This ensures that predictions remain physically consistent, leading to more reliable and interpretable traffic forecasts.

 **Topic 3: Quantum Computing for Optimization and Inverse Problems**
 
 Optimization is widely applied in machine learning, control and operations research. Classical approaches include gradient descent and evolutionary algorithms, while modern methods integrate deep learning. Classifies optimization problems based on computational difficulty (e.g., NP-hard problems). As quantum hardware improves, quantum computing is expected to revolutionize fields that rely on complex optimization and inverse problem-solving, enabling faster and more accurate solutions in real-world applications. A specific direction is detection technology in the physical layer of wireless communications. The optimization problem of mapping the received signal to qubits is under investigation.
  
**Topic 1: Digital Twin (DT) for Resillient and Smart Mobility**

As quantum computing advances, PI-AI offers a bridge between classical traffic modeling and quantum-enhanced optimization. It could revolutionize real-time congestion control by solving complex vehicle routing and traffic assignment problems much faster than classical solvers. By integrating solid traffic flow theories, efficient quantum AI technologies, we can develop next-generation mobility platform that are resilient, adaptive, and sustainable.
